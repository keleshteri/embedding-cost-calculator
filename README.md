# Embedding Cost Calculator

A tool to analyze token counts and estimate costs for OpenAI's embedding models

## Overview

This application helps you estimate the costs of using OpenAI's embedding models for large datasets, particularly focused on property data. It includes:

- A tokenizer to estimate token counts from your actual data
- A cost calculator for different OpenAI embedding models
- Support for planning large-scale embedding projects

## Features

- **Token Analyzer**: Paste your data to see approximate token counts
- **Cost Estimator**: Calculate embedding costs across different models
- **Interactive Interface**: Easy-to-use tabs and inputs
- **Example Data**: Sample property data for testing

## Usage

1. Use the Tokenizer tab to analyze your property data's token count
2. Switch to the Calculator tab to estimate costs based on your token count and property volume
3. Adjust parameters to optimize your embedding strategy

## Models Supported

- text-embedding-3-small ($0.02 per 1M tokens)
- text-embedding-3-large ($0.13 per 1M tokens)
- text-embedding-ada-002 ($0.10 per 1M tokens)
